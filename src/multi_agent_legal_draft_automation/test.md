Applicant, [applicant mark] (hereinafter "Applicant"), respectfully submits the following response to the Office Action, regarding the above referenced application:

# ARGUMENT AGAINST REFUSAL UNDER 2(d) LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION

The Examining Attorney preliminarily refused registration of Applicant's word mark because of the mark in U.S. Registration No. 2855816

# The Standard

The likelihood of confusion between two marks under Section 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1052, is determined on a case by case basis, aided by the Du Pont factors. The thirteen factors set forth in DuPont are used to determine a likelihood of confusion between two marks, where available. These factors are:

1. The similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression.
2. The similarity or dissimilarity and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.
3. The similarity or dissimilarity of established, likely-to-continue trade channels.
4. The conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made, i.e. "impulse" vs. careful, sophisticated purchasing.
5. The fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).
6. The number and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods.
7. The nature and extent of any actual confusion.
8. The length of time during and conditions under which there has been concurrent use without evidence of actual confusion.
9. The variety of goods on which a mark is or is not used (house mark, "family" mark, product mark).
10. The market interface between applicant and the owner of a prior mark:
11. The extent to which applicant has a right to exclude others from use of its mark on its goods.
12. The extent of potential confusion, i.e., whether de minimis or substantial.
13. Any other established fact probative of the effect of use.

Application of E. I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (C.C.P.A. 1973).

A. The dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression

   In determining the likelihood of confusion in trademark disputes, one of the primary considerations is the dissimilarity of the marks in their entirety regarding appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. The legal argument here hinges on the principle that trademarks must be evaluated in their entirety to understand the holistic impression they impart to the average consumer. This principle is rooted in the Lanham Act as interpreted by precedential case law such as *In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.*, 476 F.2d 1357, which emphasizes that each factor should be weighed according to its relevance to the specific context of the case at hand. For instance, a stark visual distinction between the marks or a significant difference in pronunciation could negate the likelihood of confusion even if other elements bear some similarity. Similarly, if the connotation of a mark in the relevant market significantly differs, it suggests that consumers would not likely assume a relation between the goods or services provided. The commercial impression, which encompasses the overall perception created by the mark after all aspects are considered, must therefore be distinctive enough to guide a conclusion against confusing similarity.

B. The dissimilarity and nature of the goods or services and trade channels of the two marks

   The argument for evaluating the dissimilarity and nature of the goods or services, along with their trade channels, is grounded in the necessity to determine how a typical consumer might encounter the marks in real-world conditions. Legal analysis here entails comparing the goods or services provided under each mark, how they are marketed, and sold, along with any shared or divergent channels. The legal premise is upheld under cases such as *Du Pont* and *AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats*, 599 F.2d 341, where itâ€™s articulated that the nature and similarity of the goods or services determine how the perception of dissimilarity affects consumer impression and potential market confusion. Even if marks might be similar, selling entirely different products within distinct trade channels can weigh heavily against confusion. For example, the likelihood of confusion diminishes where one mark is used on high-end electronic goods sold in specialty stores, while the other is present on low-cost household items available in grocery chains.

C. The conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made, sophisticated purchasing

   This legal argument focuses on the purchasing context and the level of consumer care, which can significantly influence perceptions of confusion. The presumption here operates on the understanding that sophisticated or knowledgeable buyers, such as those engaged in purchasing highly specialized or expensive items, exercise greater care than the average consumer, thereby reducing the likelihood of confusion despite potential mark similarities. Legal precedents like *Octocom Systems, Inc. v. Houston Computer Services, Inc.*, 918 F.2d 937, support this factor by highlighting how markets involving professional or expert consumers necessitate a higher burden of proof regarding potential confusion. Additionally, industries where purchasing decisions are significant and infrequent, such as luxury markets or technical goods sectors, buyers are likely to conduct extensive research and comparison, mitigating risks of mistaking one product or service for another solely based on trademark similarity. The surrounding conditions of sales, therefore, assuage the potential for consumer confusion, thereby lowering the chance of trademark infringement.

**Conclusion**

There is no likelihood of confusion between the Applicant's mark [applicant mark] and the Cited Mark [conflicting mark]. Considering the foregoing arguments, Applicant respectfully requests that the Examining Attorney withdraw the partial refusal to register Applicant's mark.
